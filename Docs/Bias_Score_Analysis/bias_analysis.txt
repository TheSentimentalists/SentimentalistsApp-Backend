Representing our information in a "traffic light" shape, considering credibility, polarity and subjectivity.

Dismissed the idea of multiplying subjectivity by 2 if the value is above 0.5 (website articles tend to get a balanced / neutral rating, so no need for that ...).

The ABS(POL * SUBJ) will be in average around "0.04" (looking at the tests we have done ...), maybe we should make the horizontal line "thinner" / reducing the scale, as the values will be always very close to zero.

"Cosmetic" features can be changed...
